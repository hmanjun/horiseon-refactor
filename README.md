# Horiseon Refactor

## Description

This repositor has code that refactors original Horiseaon webpage to be more accesible. To achieve accesibility, multiple modifications where made: adoption of semantic elements, 
addition of alt atributes to images, and removal of redundant classes. The end product is a webpage that hadn't changed in appearance but is more accesible.
